jesus = ['The feeding of 5000 men was one of Jesus’ miracles. It is the only miracle that is recorded in all four Gospels.','24 of Jesus’ miracles were healing miracles, 10 were nature’s miracle and 3 resurrection miracles.','Jesus raised 3 persons from the dead. The son of a widow in Nain, Jairus’ daughter and Lazarus.','Jairus’ daughter was 12 years old when Jesus brought her back to life.','Jesus used “fish” to perform a miracle 4 times in His earthly ministry: 1. When He fed 5000 men; 2. When a coin appeared in the mouth of a fish to pay taxes; 3. When Jesus told Simon Peter to let down his nets again, then they were filled with fish; 4. When Jesus told the disciples who were fishing to cast their net on the right side of the boat, and it was filled with fish.','Every quote Jesus used against Satan was from the book of Deuteronomy.','Jesus spoke on earth 3 languages: Aramaic was his first language, Hebrew for scholarly questions and Greek on some occasions.','Jesus’ earthly ministry last about 3.5 years.','In every one of Jesus’ recorded prayers, He addressed God as “Father.”','Jesus was a single man who never fathered any children','Many scholars agree that during his stay on earth, Jesus was an unmarried heterosexual virgin and was circumcised, as were all other Jewish male babies, on the eighth day after his birth.','There is a cult group, called Children of God, that actively encourages its members to imagine Jesus is joining them during sexual intercourse and masturbation.','Jesus had been on the cross from approximately 9:00 A.M. until 3:00 P.M., a total of six hours.','Jesus spoke on earth 3 languages: Aramaic was his first language, Hebrew for scholarly questions and Greek on some occasions.','Following His resurrection from the dead, Jesus appeared 12 times to his disciples and followers.','Because Jesus was a Jew, he almost certainly had Jewish features, such as olive skin, brown eyes, and black hair','Before Jesus died, he said, "I am thirsty." In response, he was offered wine mixed with myrrh or gall to drink. He refused it.','Torture in Christs day was meant to psychologically destroy someone before they died physical wounds.','Scholars believe Jesus was about 5 feet, 5 inches (1.7 meters) tall, which is about the average height for an adult male at the time.','Jesus last name wasn’t Christ','Jesus was not a vegetarian','God spoke to Jesus audibly three times','Jesus was betrayed for 30 pieces of silver','esus was under extreme stress before the crucifixion','Mary was present at Christ’s birth and death','God Split the Sea Through Moses','Moses Was the Greatest Prophet','Moses Lived 120 Years','Approximately 100 million bibles are sold every year','Jesus was not an only child. He actually had siblings. It might be hard to imagine what it was like to be Jesus’ little brother or sister, but Mary and Joseph would go on to have other children after His miraculous birth.','Jesus had humble beginnings. Born into a carpenters family, Jesus came from a poor, day-laborer home. This means Jesus would have known what it was like to live in poverty and have hunger and need. Although Jesus is the Son of God, He decided to come to earth as an ordinary guy, just like you and me.','Jesus struggled when faced with death. We all know Jesus came to sacrifice His life for us, but we forget He was a human who struggled, just like you and me. Upon facing His death in the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus was anxious and prayed that God would take this suffering from Him if possible.','Jesus came to Earth for more than to die on the cross for our sins. He came to experience life as a human so that He can empathize with us. He experienced heartache, rejection, deception, loss, sickness, and death, just like us. God wanted His Son, Jesus, to experience all the heartache of this world, so when we pray, its not just to the Creator but to the God who understands our pain firsthand. We pray to the God who really hears our prayers, sees our hearts, and feels our pain.']
